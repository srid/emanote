# Architecture

Emanote is a [Haskell](https://srid.ca/haskell) program that, at its essense, transforms a bunch of "source files" (Markdown, static files, etc.) into a "target website". It does that in a [reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) manner such that as the source files change the resultant website updates in real-time (thanks to [Ema](https://ema.srid.ca/)'s [hot-reload](https://ema.srid.ca/topics/hot-reload) via websocket). 

Emanote's high-level architecture is as follows,

- `Emanote.Source`: manages source files and communicates them to `Emanote.Model`.
  - The key concept here is the notion of "union mount", implemented by `Emanote.Source.Mount`, which will eventually be made its own Haskell library.
- `Emanote.Model`: Haskell types & machinary to represent the source files in memory, as well as a way to efficiently index and query into them.
  - The individual modules in this package should be `import`ed separately to use the specific model types.
- `Emanote.Route`: Route types
  - `Emanote.Route.ModelRoute`: Haskell route types to point to somewhere in `Emanote.Model` (eg: route to a .md file, or a route to a .jpeg file)
  - `Emanote.Route.SiteRoute`: Haskell route types pointing to somewhere in the generated site.
- `Emanote.View`: Rendering code (HTML, templates, site routes)
- `Emanote.Pandoc`: Everything to do with light-weight markup processing
  - `Emanote.Pandoc.Markdown`: Markdown-specific parsers and syntax.
  - `Emanote.Pandoc.Renderer`: Emanote-specific transformation of Pandoc AST, via Heist custom splicing.

Ema acts as the framework orchestrating two things at the same time: 

1. `Emanote.Source.emanate` which is responsible for keeping the in-memory `Model` in sync with what's on disk
1. `Emanote.View.render` which, whilst querying the `Model`, is responsible for producing the final HTML for every `SiteRoute` in the target website.

In addition, we have the following non-source files in the Git repository that are vital to Emanote's functionality:

- `./default`: The primary and first "[[layer|layer]]" used, which provides the default HTML templates (we use Heist), `index.md` and a favicon. Users can override these by creating an equivalent file (same path) in their own layer.
