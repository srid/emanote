# File WikiLinks

`[[..]]` style wikilinks can link to not only Markdown files, but also to any *other* files.

For example, here is a link to some text file: [[Sample.txt]]

You can also specify the full, or subset of, the path: [[demo/Sample.txt]]

Of course, a custom link text may also be specified: [[Sample.txt|Some text file]]
