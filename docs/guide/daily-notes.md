# Daily Notes

Emanote has special support for [Obsidian style daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/daily-notes).

If you create notes named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`, Emanote will treat them as daily notes. This has a couple of effects:

1. The backlinks panel will render daily notes separate from regular notes. The daily notes will be rendered as a "timeline" in reverse chronological order.
2. Each daily note automatically gets a hierarchical tag (eg: `#calendar/2025/03`) allowing you to browse them by calendar navigation in the tag index.
