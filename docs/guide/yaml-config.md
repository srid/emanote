# YAML configuration

Configure your site metadata, rendering configuration and such using YAML configuration. Create a `foo.yaml` alongside `foo.md` (see [[folder-note]]) or `foo/` folder, and those settings apply only to that route. The YAML structure is the same as your Markdown frontmatter, and vice-versa. Settings in the YAML frontmatter apply onto that Markdown route only; whereas settings in an individual .yaml file apply to that entire sub-route tree. Emanote does a deep-merge of the parent YAML configurations, so you can have children override only what's necessary. This is sometimes known as ["data cascade"](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/). The final merged YAML structure is passed to the HTML templates, of which you have full rendering control over.

Notice how this page's sidebar colorscheme has [changed to green]{.greenery}? View [the source of this page](https://github.com/srid/emanote/blob/master/docs/guide/yaml-config.md) to see the magic involved. That CSS greenery you just saw too comes from YAML.

>[!tip] Using in HTML templates
> You can reference the YAML frontmatter config from [[html-template]]. See [here](https://github.com/srid/emanote/discussions/131#discussioncomment-1382189) for details.

## Special properties

- `page.image`: The image to use for the page. This is used for the [[ogp]] meta tag `og:image` meta tag. If not specified, the first image in the page is used. Relative URLs are automatically rewritten to absolute URLs if `page.siteUrl` is non-empty.

- `date`: The note timestamp. This is used to order note chronologically, such as for the timeline [[query|query]].
  The value can be set from the filename if it begins with `YYYY-MM-DD`, which is useful for including the date in the note URL.
  In case of conflict, the date from the YAML configuration takes priority.
