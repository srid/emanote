# Uplink tree

The _uplink tree_ or "uptree"[^neuron] is a feature available in #[[html-template]], which visualizes hierarchical relationships between notes as a graph at the top of the page.

[^neuron]: This feature was inspired by an equivalent feature [from Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/uplink-tree).

These relationships are called by [[folgezettel]].

To enable the uptree, add the following to your [[yaml-config]]:

```yaml
template:
  uptree: 
    enable: true
```
