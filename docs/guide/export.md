# Export

Emanote supports exporting your notebook content in different formats:

## JSON export {#json}

The metadata of all content ([[markdown]] and [[orgmode]]), along with their link relationships, can be retrieved as `JSON` using one of the following means:

1. `emanote export metadata`: a CLI command that dumps the JSON export to stdout.
2. [/-/export.json](-/export.json): an URL to retrieve the JSON via live server or from the statically generated site.

## Content export {#md}

All notes from your notebook can be exported as a single Markdown document optimized for LLMs using:

1. `emanote export content`: a CLI command that dumps the content export to stdout.
2. [/-/export.md](-/export.md): an URL to retrieve the content via live server or from the statically generated site.

The content export includes:
- All notes with their original Markdown content
- Metadata headers with source paths, titles, and wikilinks
- Optional URLs (when `page.siteUrl` is configured in your notebook)
- LLM-optimized formatting with clear note delimiters

## CLI examples

### JSON export examples {#json-ex}

Here are some examples of running `emanote export metadata`. These commands are run on the `./docs` directory of the Emanote source repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/srid/emanote.git
cd ./emanote/docs
```

#### Get the list of files

```sh
$ emanote export metadata | jq .files | jq keys
[
  "architecture.md",
  "demo.md",
  "demo/custom-style.md",
  "demo/embed.md",
  "demo/file-links.md",
  [..]
]
```

#### Get a single file

```sh
$ emanote export metadata | jq '.files | .[] | select(.filePath=="architecture.md")'   
{
  "filePath": "architecture.md",
  "links": [],
  "meta": {
    "order": 99,
    "page": {
      "description": "Emanote is a Haskell program that, at its essense, transforms a bunch of source files (Markdown, static files, etc.) into a target website. It does that in a reactive manner such that as the source files change the resultant website updates in real-time (thanks to Ema's hot-reload via websocket)."
    },
    "tags": [
      "emanote/dev"
    ]
  },
  "parentNote": "index.md",
  "title": "Architecture",
  "url": "architecture"
}
```

#### Get all link targets from a note

```sh
$ emanote export metadata | jq '.files | .[] | select(.filePath=="start/neuron.md") | .links | .[] | .resolvedRelTarget.contents'
"demo/neuron-layout"
"demo/yaml-config"
"demo/yaml-config"
"demo/file-links"
"demo"
```

#### Get the list of tags

```sh
$ emanote export metadata | jq '.files | .[] | .meta.tags' | jq -s 'flatten(1)'
[
  "emanote/dev",
  "emanote/syntax/demo",
  "emanote/syntax/demo",
  "emanote/syntax/demo",
  "emanote/yaml/demo",
  "external"
]
```

#### Get all files associated with a tag

```sh
$ emanote export metadata | jq '.files | .[] | select( any( .meta.tags[]; . == "external" ))'   
{
  "filePath": "examples.md",
  "links": [],
  "meta": {
    "order": 10,
    "page": {
      "description": "Here is an assorted collection of websites generated by Emanote, sorted alphabetically:"
    },
    "tags": [
      "external"
    ]
  },
  "parentNote": "index.md",
