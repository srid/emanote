Feature: Smoke
  Backend-agnostic checks that the Tailwind v4 CSS pipeline
  produces a usable site in both live (`emanote run`, Tailwind CDN
  MutationObserver) and static (`emanote gen`, Tailwind CLI) modes.

  Scenario: CSS loads on the home page
    When I open "/"
    Then the primary palette custom property resolves to a non-empty value

  Scenario: Per-page template.theme override is applied
    Given I note the resolved primary palette at "/"
    When I open "/themed.html"
    Then the resolved primary palette differs from the noted value

  Scenario: Inline math renders to MathML at build time
    When I open "/math.html"
    Then the page contains an inline <math> element in the MathML namespace

  Scenario: Display math renders to block MathML at build time
    When I open "/math.html"
    Then the page contains a block <math> element in the MathML namespace

  Scenario: KaTeX is not loaded by default
    When I open "/math.html"
    Then no KaTeX stylesheet is referenced

  Scenario: Embedded notes do not produce duplicate footnote ids
    When I open "/footnote-embed.html"
    Then every element id on the page is unique
    And at least one footnote id is present

  Scenario: Callout bodies do not produce duplicate footnote ids
    When I open "/footnote-callout.html"
    Then every element id on the page is unique
    And at least one footnote id is present
